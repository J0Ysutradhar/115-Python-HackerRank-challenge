| Advantages of Microwave | Disadvantages of Microwave |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------|
| • Microwave spectrum bandwidth is very high, so a large amount of data can be transmitted at once. | • In this method, both transmitter and receiver must be in a straight line (line-of-sight). |
| • No need for cables or wires. | • Signals can be weakened by air and weather conditions, especially during bad weather. |
| • Suitable for satellite communication. | • Weather-dependent performance. |
| • Used for communication in remote areas. | |
| • Works effectively even in emergency and natural disaster situations. | |
