| Terrestrial Microwave Communication | Satellite Microwave Communication |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| • Communication happens between fixed transmitters and receivers on the ground using line-of-sight. | • First artificial satellite was launched in 1957. |
| • For use, transmitter stations are placed at 25–30 km intervals and on high natural places like hills. | • Initially satellites were placed in low orbit. But controlling them took more time. So, now they are placed in geosynchronous orbit (about 36,000 km above the Earth). |
| • Each transmission station amplifies the signal and sends it to the next station. | • Satellites contain basic transmitters, receivers, processor units, and antennas. |
| • Stations are placed on tall buildings, towers, or hills. | • The uplink signal (sent to satellite) is between 6 × 10⁹ Hz. It is received and converted to 4 × 10⁹ Hz and sent back to Earth (downlink). |
| • Microwave dishes are used. |  |
