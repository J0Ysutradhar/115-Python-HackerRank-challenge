| A. Asynchronous data transmission is relatively cheaper.             | Requires primary storage.                           |
| B. Continuous data transmission results in relatively higher speed.  | More expensive compared to asynchronous transmission.|
| C. No interval is needed after each character.                       | From computer to computer only.                     |
| D. No start and stop bits are needed before and after data.          | To send data to distant locations.                  |
| E. Takes comparatively less time.                                    |                                                      |
