**Task**

You are given **N** numbers. Store them in a list and find the second largest number.

**Input Format**

The first line contains an integer, **N**, the size of the list.  
The second line contains **N** space-separated integers that make up the list.

**Constraints**

- \( 2 \leq N \leq 10^2 \)  
- \( -100 \leq A[i] \leq 100 \), where \( A[i] \) is an element of the list.

**Output Format**

Print the second largest number.

**Sample Input 0**
```
5
2 3 6 6 5
```

**Sample Output 0**
```
5
