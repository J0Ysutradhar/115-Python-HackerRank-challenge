# Python Arithmetic Operators
**Task**

Read two integers from the user and print the results of the following arithmetic operations:

1. The sum of the two numbers.
2. The difference when the second number is subtracted from the first.
3. The product of the two numbers.

**Input Format**

The first line contains the first integer, **a**.  
The second line contains the second integer, **b**.

**Constraints**

- \( 1 \leq a \leq 10^{10} \)  
- \( 1 \leq b \leq 10^{10} \)

**Output Format**

Print three lines:  
1. The first line should contain the result of **a + b**.  
2. The second line should contain the result of **a - b**.  
3. The third line should contain the result of **a * b**.

**Sample Input 0**
```
3
2
```

**Sample Output 0**
```
5
1
6
```

**Explanation**

- The sum of the two numbers: \( 3 + 2 = 5 \)  
- The difference when the second number is subtracted from the first: \( 3 - 2 = 1 \)  
- The product of the two numbers: \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \)
